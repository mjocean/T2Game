# T2Game
A [SkeletonGame](https://github.com/mjocean/PyProcGameHD-SkeletonGame)-based recreation of the "stock" Terminator 2 pinball ruleset.

It is intended to be used as an aid for aspiring SkeletonGame developers as a more complete example than the [`SampleGame`](https://github.com/mjocean/PyProcGameHD-SkeletonGame/tree/master/SampleGame) that is included with SkeletonGame.  A familiarity with the original rule set of the Terminator 2 pinball machine is helpful, to see how those rules can be created in the SkeletonGame framework.

This is very much a work in progress.  Not all functionality has been reproduced at this time.

It cannot be used as-is; assets are not included.
